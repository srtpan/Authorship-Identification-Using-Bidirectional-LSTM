# Authorship-Identification-Using-Bidirectional-LSTM

Author identification is an important topic in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With its help, we can identify the author of a text, article, news and it can help us detect plagiarism, literary theft and identify anonymous authors to help researchers with attributions. In this project, I made use of discriminative neural network models on Reuters 50 50 and Gutenberg dataset. In the two approaches, article-level LSTM achieved the best accuracy of 68.8% for Reuters 50 50 dataset and 79.28% for Gutneberg dataset.

Authorship identification is the process of identifying the author of a piece of text using various Natural Language Processing methods. The process involves decoding the pattern and style of writing of an author and using that to identify the original author. The writing style is to an extent irrelevant to the topics in question but the style helps distinguish one author from another by a human reader.

One of the applications of author identification is to match an anonymous text with its potential author. It can also be used to detect plagiarism and resolve the rising threat to writing posed by AI systems like the latest ChatGPT. Researchers will benefit by being able to identify and cite text from unknown sources.
